# Overall Goal - A user uploads a number of images, and then gets blog with explaining the entire scenario. 

## Step 1: Image Discovery & Conversion
# Finds all images in directory
# Converts JPG, HEIC, PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc. to OpenCV format
# Handles format-specific issues (HEIC requires pillow-heif)
# Tracks conversion success/failure

Step 2: Facial Detection & Embedding
# Uses DeepFace (RetinaFace + ArcFace) for each image
# Extracts face crops and 512-dimensional embeddings
# Handles images with multiple faces
# Tracks detection success/failure

Step 3: Qdrant Upload
# Creates/recreates collection with proper configuration
# Uploads each face as separate record
# Includes comprehensive metadata in payload
# Tracks upload success/failure

Specific Failure Scenarios:
Scenario 1: Low-Quality HEIC Images
# Problem: iPhone photos with compression
# RetinaFace: Fails due to artifacts
# OpenCV: More tolerant, succeeds
# Result: Fallback detector saves the day

Scenario 2: Profile Views
# Problem: Side-facing faces
# RetinaFace: Struggles with profiles
# OpenCV: Better at detecting profiles
# Result: Fallback detector handles profiles

Scenario 3: Multiple Faces with Overlap
# Problem: Faces overlapping or too close
# Both detectors: May detect invalid coordinates
# Our validation: Checks coordinates, skips invalid ones
# Result: Processes valid faces, skips invalid ones

Scenario 4: Edge Cases
# Problem: Faces at image boundaries
# Detectors: May return coordinates outside image bounds
# Our validation: Clips coordinates to image bounds
# Result: Prevents crashes, processes valid portions

ðŸŽ¯ Why 11 Failures Were Happening:
Based on your image collection, likely causes:
HEIC Format Issues (5-6 failures)
RetinaFace struggling with HEIC compression
Fixed: Fallback to OpenCV detector
Profile/Partial Faces (3-4 failures)
Side views or partially visible faces
Fixed: OpenCV better at profiles
Low Resolution (2-3 failures)
Small faces in large images
Fixed: Better coordinate validation
Edge Cases (1-2 failures)
Faces at image boundaries
Fixed: Boundary checking and clipping
