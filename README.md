## Overall Goal - A user goes onto the app, clicks a photo, and gets a description of the photos, including the names of the people in the photo. It performs facial recognition.

## Pipeline 
1. Streamlit
2. A reference collection of people is created where for each image the face is detected, embedded using facial embedding and then stored in Qdrant, along with the people's names in the payload. 
3. Facial detection and facial embedding is performed on a user-clicked photo. 
4. Vector search is performed against the reference collection.
5. Multimodal embedding for the user-clicked photo is performed.
6. Then the multimodal model, along with the names of the people recognised by facial recognition,
is passed into a multimodal generative LLM.

Final Result: A comprehensive image description that identifies known people and describes the scene context, generated by combining facial recognition results with multimodal AI analysis.

## Setup Instructions :
### Qdrant : In order, to run the code and setup qdrant, please follow the following steps. 

Step 1 : Download Docker Desktop. Verify installation using :
    docker --version

Step 2: Pull Qdrant Image
    docker pull/qdrant/qdrant

Step 3 : Run Qdrant container 
    docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
-p 6333:6333 → exposes Qdrant’s HTTP API on port 6333.

Step 4 : Test Qdrant id running, by opening it in the browser.
    http://localhost:6333/dashboard

Step 5 : Install qdrant client
    uv add qdrant_client

Note : The current code runs qdrant locally!
