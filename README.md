## Overall Goal - A user goes onto the app, clicks a photo, and gets a description of the photos, including the names of the people in the photo. It performs facial recognition.

## Pipeline 
1. Streamlit
2. A reference collection of people is created where for each image the face is detected, embedded using facial embedding and then stored in Qdrant, along with the people's names in the payload. 
3. Facial detection and facial embedding is performed on a user-clicked photo. 
4. Vector search is performed against the reference collection.
5. Multimodal embedding for the user-clicked photo is performed.
6. Then the multimodal model, along with the names of the people recognised by facial recognition,
is passed into a multimodal generative LLM.

Final Result: A comprehensive image description that identifies known people and describes the scene context, generated by combining facial recognition results with multimodal AI analysis.

## Setup Instructions :
### Qdrant : In order, to run the code and setup qdrant, please follow the following steps. 

Step 1 : Download Docker Desktop. Verify installation using :
    docker --version

Step 2: Pull Qdrant Image
    docker pull/qdrant/qdrant

Step 3 : Run Qdrant container 
    docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
-p 6333:6333 → exposes Qdrant’s HTTP API on port 6333.

Step 4 : Test Qdrant id running, by opening it in the browser.
    http://localhost:6333/dashboard

Step 5 : Install qdrant client
    uv add qdrant_client

Note : The current code runs qdrant locally!

## Learnings
#### Step 1: Image Discovery & Conversion
- Finds all images in directory
- Converts JPG, HEIC, PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc. to OpenCV format
- Handles format-specific issues (HEIC requires pillow-heif)
- Tracks conversion success/failure

#### Step 2: Facial Detection & Embedding
- Uses DeepFace (RetinaFace + ArcFace) for each image
- Extracts face crops and 512-dimensional embeddings
- Handles images with multiple faces
- Tracks detection success/failure

#### Step 3: Qdrant Upload
- Creates/recreates collection with proper configuration
- Uploads each face as separate record
- Includes comprehensive metadata in payload
- Tracks upload success/failure

### Specific Failure Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Low-Quality HEIC Images
- Problem: iPhone photos with compression
- RetinaFace: Fails due to artifacts
- OpenCV: More tolerant, succeeds
- Result: Fallback detector saves the day

#### Scenario 2: Profile Views
- Problem: Side-facing faces
- RetinaFace: Struggles with profiles
- OpenCV: Better at detecting profiles
- Result: Fallback detector handles profiles

#### Scenario 3: Multiple Faces with Overlap
- Problem: Faces overlapping or too close
- Both detectors: May detect invalid coordinates
- Our validation: Checks coordinates, skips invalid ones
- Result: Processes valid faces, skips invalid ones

#### Scenario 4: Edge Cases
- Problem: Faces at image boundaries
- Detectors: May return coordinates outside image bounds
- Our validation: Clips coordinates to image bounds
- Result: Prevents crashes, processes valid portions


### Why 11 Failures Were Happening:

Based on your image collection, likely causes:

#### HEIC Format Issues (5-6 failures)
- RetinaFace struggling with HEIC compression
- **Fixed:** Fallback to OpenCV detector

#### Profile/Partial Faces (3-4 failures)
- Side views or partially visible faces
- **Fixed:** OpenCV better at profiles

#### Low Resolution (2-3 failures)
- Small faces in large images
- **Fixed:** Better coordinate validation

#### Edge Cases (1-2 failures)
- Faces at image boundaries
- **Fixed:** Boundary checking and clipping
